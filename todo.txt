TODO Tasks:

- Generated code should be obtained via some sort of templating.
- Use yaml config to define path-related configurations
    - Where are bounded contexts located.
    - Where are DDD elements located inside a bounded context.
- A lot of code is being duplicated now, find a way (if it makes sense) to abstract that code (i.e. generator classes, finders...)
- Commands that generate DTO elements (such as events, commands, queries...) should ask for primitive types that will be added to the generated class.
- Configure Bundle and push it to packagist
- Every class that is generated, should be generated in tests directory as well following same path.
- Tests. In to test the bundle, all I/O functions (i.e. scandir(), file_put_contents()...) that are being used will have to be abstracted to an interface so we can mock them in tests.

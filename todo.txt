TODO Tasks:

- Configure third party dependencies through using composer.

- Whenever a class is generated, ask if class should be as well added as '{ClassName}Test' with same path to tests directory.

- Tests. To test the bundle, all I/O functions (i.e. scandir(), file_put_contents()...) that are being used will have to be abstracted to an interface to allow mocking during test execution.

- Command to create full bounded context
- Command to add module to existing bounded context
- Command to generate Repositories (both ports and adapters)
- Push bundle to packagist

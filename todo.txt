TODO Tasks:


- Every class that is generated, should be generated in tests directory as well following same path.
- Use DI (now most services/collaborator classes are explicitly instantiated)
- Now php code generation is being done "by hand", check out https://github.com/nette/php-generator to generate classes

- Some code is being duplicated now, find a way (if it makes sense) to abstract that code (i.e. generator classes, finders...)
- Tests. To test the bundle, all I/O functions (i.e. scandir(), file_put_contents()...) that are being used will have to be abstracted to an interface to allow mocking during test execution.

- Command to create full bounded context
- Configure Bundle and push it to packagist

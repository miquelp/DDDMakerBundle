TODO Tasks:

- Use yaml config to define paths and generated code configurations
    - Where are bounded contexts located.
    - Where are DDD elements located inside a bounded context.
    - What interface, if any, should DDD elements implement.
    - What class, if any, should DDD elements extend from.
- Some code is being duplicated now, find a way (if it makes sense) to abstract that code (i.e. generator classes, finders...)
- Every class that is generated, should be generated in tests directory as well following same path.
- Tests. To test the bundle, all I/O functions (i.e. scandir(), file_put_contents()...) that are being used will have to be abstracted to an interface to allow mocking during test execution.
- Configure Bundle and push it to packagist
